  5. Functions.cpp - This program illustrates the use of functions by asking the user for three integers and outputting the largest and smallest integer respectively. 
  
  6. Compound.cpp - Includes a project that I created for my final project in Data Structures in C++. I included a pdf of the presentation and explaination of the project to demonstrate the concepts used. Uses a variety of functions to generate chemistry conversions and perform basic stoichmetry calcultions 


  7. Balannce that Checking.cpp - This program is designed to breakdown the user's monthly income into pre-tax deductions, tax, post-tax deductions, bills, savings and disposible income.
